### I tried to focus on

- writing CSS/HTML that is easy even for others to understand.
- making the responsive design without media queries.
- building mobile first.
- No random margin or padding just to make it look like the goal design.

##### üì±Mobile Version

First of all, I tried to understand the structure and grouped elements by drawing outlines (as in the picture below).<br>
I think it helped me a lot later on when I set margin and padding as well.

<img src="readme/design-plan.PNG" height="400px" alt="Outline">

- **Annual Plan and the price** is slightly closer to music icon. That's why I grouped them out.
- **Order Summary** had exactly same margin for top and bottom and didn't wanna have extra gap between the next element, which is a paragraph. That's why it's excluded from the float "inner-wrapper". I could use `<h1></h1>` instead of `<h2></h2>`. I thought there could be something else and intensionally avoided. But `<h1></h1>` shouldn't be a problem.

One thing, I couldn't find the best way is here.

```html
<div class="plan-details">
  <img src="images/icon-music.svg" alt="" />
  <div>
    <strong>Annual Plan</strong>
    <small>$59.99/year</small>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.plan-details {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1.5rem;
}
```

At first, I thought that I could use float:left on the icon.<br> Then, because it looks like some sort of list, even though it has only one item in it, I tried to use list and set the image as list-style-image but it didn't work as I imagined.<br>
It was easier to center the text vertically by flexbox.
So I ended up using flexbox. I don't know if it was a good solution since now I have a flex in a flex item. And it looks a bit complicated for such a simple thing.

#### üñ•Ô∏èDesktop Version

To adjust both desktop and mobile screen, I used grid. I decided the size like this (picture below).

![Outline](readme/design-plan2.PNG)

```css
.body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(330px, calc(100vw / 3)) 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr auto 1fr;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

- All the margin around the main content is set by **1fr** to be flexible.
- To my eyes, desktop version looked a little wider so that's why I used **minmax(330px, calc(100vw / 3))**

###### Little about me

I'm studying front-end programming in Stockholm, Sweden.
Front-end programming lesson started in October 2021.
We just finished basic HTML and CSS and to review what I have been though in the lessons I wanted to try this challenge.
This is my very first README.md as well.
